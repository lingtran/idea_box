## Synopsis

Single-page app with full CRUD functionality for capturing ideas. Focus was to provide a fluid and responsive client-side interface.


## Tech Stack

##### Front-end
> JavaScript | jQuery | AJAX | HTML | CSS

##### Back-end
> Ruby on Rails | Ruby | PostgreSQL | ActiveRecord

## Motivation

This project's learning goals were focused on delving deeper into understanding the difference between "server" and "client" entities. It focused on creating a Rails application to manage data related to ideas, serve initial UI templates, and to manage client-side interactions and communication asynchronously with the server. Obtained more experience doing DOM manipulations and AJAX event handling without using any client-side frameworks. All AJAX functionality was triggered by jQuery.
